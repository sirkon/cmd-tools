#
# Usage:
#  - Set `$PROJECT_PATHS` in your ~/.zshrc
#    e.g.: PROJECT_PATHS=(~/src ~/work)
#  - In ZSH you now can open a project directory with the command: `pj my-project`
#    the plugin will locate the `my-project` directory in one of the $PROJECT_PATHS
#    Also tab completion is supported.
#  - `pjo my-project` will open the directory in $EDITOR
#

function gj() {
	cd `gopref $1`
}

function gjo() {
	goland-launcher `gopref $1`
}
